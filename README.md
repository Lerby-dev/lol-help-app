# LolHelpApp
-------------------
This project is based on working with the Riot API. 
To do this, you need the correct api-key, which you should get from the Riot Games developer site.

https://developer.riotgames.com/


Now change the key to your newer one and you should be able to get the project to work.
But I must warn you, as Riot Games is updated very often.
This can interfere with the work of the project. 
The version of the Api Riot for which the project is written is v4.
